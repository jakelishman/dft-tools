# NAME
#   scf-extract-results.sh - extract magnetisation and total energy levels from
#                            output files generated by kkrscf into CSV files
# 
# SYNOPSIS
#   scf-extract-results.sh folder1 [folder2 [...]]
#   qsub scf-extract-results.sh -F "folder1 [folder2 [...]]"
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   Bash script for extracting lattice parameters, magnetisation and total
#   integrated energy from output files generated by the `kkrscf` program from
#   the SPR-KKR package.  The lattice parameter is extracted from the file name
#   (we expect names in the format "6.000000.out", where "6.000000" can be
#   replaced by the relevant parameter.  We expect `kkrscf` to have been
#   invoked using the also supplied `scf-run.sh` script, which automatically
#   generates all the necessary files.
#
#   Prints results to standard output - we expect you to redirect it to where
#   you want it.
